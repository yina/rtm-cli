Remember The Milk Command Line Interface
========================================

This repository is a clone from [dwaring87/rtm-cli](https://github.com/dwaring87/rtm-cli). 
It attempts to customize for machine
readable outputs. It is virtually identical to the original
fork except putting pipes in the outputs for parsing.

Node module provides a command line interface, written in JavaScript,
for the popular [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) task list
manager.

### Interactive Mode

An interactive mode is started when no commands are given to `rtm`, which
allows commands to be given sequentially.

Use the `quit` command to leave the interactive mode.


### Full Usage Information

For full documentation on the usage of the built-in commands and options,
see the [Command Reference](https://github.com/dwaring87/rtm-cli/wiki/Command-Reference).


## Configuration

RTM CLI has a number of properties that can be configured using a separate JSON configuration
file. The default user configuration file is located at `$HOME/.rtm.json` but can be changed
using the `--config <file>` option.

Currently, the configuration can customize:

- the formats of displayed dates
- styled text output for different task properties
- the display of completed tasks
- the display of tasks with due dates in the future
- **custom aliases** for existing commands
  - these are useful for applying commonly used [RTM advanced search](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/answer/basics-search-advanced)
  filters to display commands
  - ex: `overdue` = `ls dueBefore:today AND status:incomplete`


For full documentation on the configuration properties, see the
[Configuration Reference](https://github.com/dwaring87/rtm-cli/wiki/Configuration-Reference).


## Plugins

RTM CLI supports adding additional commands through plugins.

For information on installing plugins, see the
[Plugin Reference](https://github.com/dwaring87/rtm-cli/wiki/Plugin-Reference).

For information on creating commands, see the **Creating Commands** section
in the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/dwaring87/rtm-cli/wiki#creating-commands).
